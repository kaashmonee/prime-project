INSTRUCTIONS:

A number is called a k-primeSum if it can be represented as a sum of k (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers. Implement a function that checks if the given number is k-primeSum or not.

Example

For n = 9 and k = 3, the output should be
primeSum(n, k) = true.

We can represent 9 as 2 + 2 + 5.
